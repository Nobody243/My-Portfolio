# Text Fill Effect Improvements & Cleanup

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Subtle Text Fill Effect**
- **Replaced aggressive animation** with subtle color flow
- **Removed aura/glow effects** for cleaner appearance
- **Slower animation duration** (8s vs 3s) for gentle movement
- **Better color gradient** that flows naturally through text

### 2. **Name Visibility Enhancement**
- **Always visible base text** - name is never hidden
- **Subtle color overlay** that flows over visible text
- **Improved readability** with proper color contrast
- **Gentle animation** that doesn't interfere with reading

### 3. **CSS Optimizations**
```css
/* Before: Aggressive with aura effects */
.text-fill-effect {
  animation: text-fill 3s ease-in-out infinite;
  /* Heavy glow and blur effects */
}

/* After: Subtle and readable */
.text-fill-effect {
  animation: text-fill-subtle 8s ease-in-out infinite;
  /* Clean gradient flow only */
}
```

### 4. **Component Updates**
- **TextFillEffect**: Disabled aura by default (`enableAura = false`)
- **TextFillLetterByLetter**: Completely rewritten for better visibility
- **Duration increased**: Slower, more peaceful animations

### 5. **File Cleanup**
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate documentation files:
  - `THEME_SYSTEM.md` (moved to `/docs`)
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (moved to `/docs`) 
  - `IMAGE_CONFIG.md` (moved to `/docs`)
